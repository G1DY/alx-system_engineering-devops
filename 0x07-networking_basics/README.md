| Tasks | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| 0. OSI model | - What is the OSI model?, How is the OSI model organized? |
| 1. Types of network | What type of network a computer in local is connected to?, What type of network could connect an office in one building to another office in a building a few streets away?, What network do you use when you browse www.google.com from your smartphone (not connected to the Wifi)? |
| 2. MAC and IP address | What is a MAC address?, What is an IP address? |
| 3. UDP and TCP | Which statement is correct for the TCP box, Which statement is correct for the UDP box:, Which statement is correct for the TCP worker |
| 4. TCP and UDP ports | Write a Bash script that displays listening ports, That only shows listening sockets, That shows the PID and name of the program to which each socket belongs |
| 5. Is the host on the network | Write a Bash script that pings an IP address passed as an argument., Accepts a string as an argument, Displays Usage: 5-is_the_host_on_the_network {IP_ADDRESS} if no argument passed, Ping the IP 5 times |
