<center> <h1>Web server</h1> </center>
In this project we covered web servers. We learnt that servers are computers that host webpages, apps and sites. When a client device wants to access a web page, a copy of the web page is downloaded from the server into the clients machine to be displayed in the users' web browser. All this happen through an internet connection via a Transmission control protocol/internet protocol(TCP/IP). HTTP is a language for clients and servers to speak to each other. Component files, code files and assets are transfered as data packets to allow transmission over distributed paths and corrupted files are easily replaced as packets
