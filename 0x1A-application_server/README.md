In this project i configured my nginx server to serve `AirBnB clone v2 - Web framework on web-01`. The task was about setting up the development environment, to be used for testing and debugging code before deploying it to production.

#### **0. Set up development with Python**

```
Letâ€™s serve what you built for `AirBnB clone v2 - Web framework on web-01`. This task is an exercise in setting up your development environment, which is used for testing and debugging your code before deploying it to production.

Requirements:

    Make sure that task #3 of your SSH project is completed for web-01. The checker will connect to your servers.
    Install the net-tools package on your server: sudo apt install -y net-tools
    Git clone your AirBnB_clone_v2 on your web-01 server.
    Configure the file web_flask/0-hello_route.py to serve its content from the route /airbnb-onepage/ on port 5000.
    Your Flask application object must be named app (This will allow us to run and check your code).
```

#### **Test**
