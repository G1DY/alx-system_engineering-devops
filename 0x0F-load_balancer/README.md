<center><h1>Load balancer</h1></center>
In this project i learnt how to setup a high availabilty infrastructure. A load balancer facilitates redundancy for the backend layer(web/app servers) but for a true high availabilty set up we need to have redundant load balancers as well. I also looked at the various algorithmns for load balancing and how they work. In the tasks i installed a HAproxy server and configured it to load balance 2 web servers.

<center><h2>Project Tasks</h2></center>

| Task | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| 0. Double the number of webservers | In this first task you need to configure `web-02` to be identical to `web-01`: Configure Nginx so that its HTTP response contains a custom header (on `web-01` and `web-02`), The name of the custom HTTP header must be `X-Served-By`, The value of the custom HTTP header must be the hostname of the server Nginx is running on. Write `0-custom_http_response_header` so that it configures a brand new Ubuntu machine to the requirements asked in this task |
| 1. Install your load balancer | Install and configure HAproxy on your lb-01 server: Configure HAproxy so that it send traffic to `web-01` and `web-02`, Distribute requests using a roundrobin algorithm, Make sure that HAproxy can be managed via an init script, Make sure that your servers are configured with the right `hostnames: [STUDENT_ID]-web-01 and [STUDENT_ID]-web-02`. If not, follow this tutorial, For your answer file, write a Bash script that configures a new Ubuntu machine to respect above requirements |
| 2. Add a custom HTTP header with Puppet | Just as in task #0, weâ€™d like you to automate the task of creating a custom HTTP header response, but with Puppet: The name of the custom HTTP header must be `X-Served-By`, The value of the custom HTTP header must be the hostname of the server Nginx is running on, Write `2-puppet_custom_http_response_header.pp` so that it configures a brand new Ubuntu machine to the requirements asked in this task |
